# Spatial Data {-}

The first part of this book introduces concepts of spatial data
science, and uses R only to generate text output or figures. The R
code used for this is not shown or explained, as it would distract
from the message. The online version of this book contains R code
at the place where it is used in sections that can be unfolded on
demand and copied into the clipboard for execution and experimenting.

The code sections in the first part are not explained, but can be
unfolded by clicking on the "code" button. They should be easy
to follow when understanding R at the level of, say, [R for Data
Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) [@r4ds]. Detailed explanation
of the R code used starts in Part II of this book.
