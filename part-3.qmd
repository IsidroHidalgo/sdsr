# Models for Spatial Data

The third and largest part of this book is dedicated to statistical
modelling of spatial data. It is now obvious that a complete
and comprehensive treatment of this topic that also includes
instructions about the use of computational software in a single book
is an impossible task; the `spatstat` book [@baddeley2015spatial]
uses 1000 pages for this, and does not include spatiotemporal point
patterns.  We focus on the three "classic" spatial statistics topics:
analysis of point patterns (@sec-pointpatterns), geostatistical data
(@sec-interpolation, @sec-stgeostatistics), and lattice (areal)
data (@sec-area, @sec-spatautocorr, @sec-spatglmm, @sec-spatecon),
and attempt to refer to further literature on methods and software
implementations in R.
