# Models for Spatial Data {#sec-part3}

The third and largest part of this book is dedicated to statistical
modelling of spatial data. It is obvious that a complete and
comprehensive treatment of this topic that also includes instructions
about the use of software is an impossible task; the `spatstat`
book [@baddeley2015spatial] uses 1000 pages for this, and does not
include spatiotemporal point patterns.
