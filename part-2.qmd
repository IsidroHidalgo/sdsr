# R for Spatial Data Science {#sec-part2}

The second part of this book explains how the concepts introduced
in part I are dealt with using R. @sec-sf deals with basic handling
of spatial data: reading, writing, subsetting, selecting by spatial
predicates, geometry transformers like buffers or intersections,
raster-vector and vector-raster conversion, handling of data cubes,
spherical geometry, coordinate transformations and conversions. This
is followed by a chapter dedicated to plotting of spatial and
spatiotemporal data with base plot, and packages `ggplot2`, `tmap`
and `mapview` that deals with projection, colours, color breaks,
graticules, graphic elements on maps like legends, and interactive
maps.  @sec-large discusses approaches to handle large vector or
raster data sets or data cubes, where "large" either means too
large to fit in memory or too large to download.
